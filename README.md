### Art Piece 1

Flight Patterns by Aaron Koblin is a piece that shows the flight patterns across the United States. By taking a backend database and translating that into a visual using an algorithm he's able to display a piece that graphically shows an central part of American life. I enjoyed the color scheme used as it depicts travel, something I enjoy, as something illuminating. In addition to the pictures he also created a video that is visually appealing

### Art Piece 2

Laplacian Cave by Nervous System is a great piece that was 3D printed to illustrate the concept of Laplacian growth. This sculpture was generated via an algorithm on the computer and brought to life through 3D printing. I appreciate the tangibility of sculptures and how the vision was transfered from a digital work to physical work. I additionally find the combination of the simplicity of a cube with the complex Laplacian shapes interesting.
