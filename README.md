### Art Piece 1

Still Moving, by Maurice Benayoun, is an interesting piece which create music on touch. It was displayed at le Grand Palais in 2008. When in physical contact with the piece it generates a signal at 5-20Hz which is too low for the human ear but is still percievable with the body. The sculpture itself is a snapshot of the web-analysis of 3200 cities relations which shows the world's mood. This piece interests me because of how complex it is with both the appearance and the sound itself being done excellently. The fact that the sound also changes depending on the geographical location on the map only add further to the appeal.

### Art Piece 2

La Plissure du Texte (The Pleating of the Text), a piece by Roy Ascott, is a remake of art of the same name made in 1983. Ascott's remake was shown Seoul, Korea in 2010. The work was created in the Second Life game where characters were given generated text from the Gutenburg Project. Visitors of the exibit could add to the text via SMS and Twitter messages. This allows the characters to have a never ending stream of dialogue. This work appealed to me because of how unique it was and the degree of user interaction really brought it to another level.
